      <h2>About me</h2>

      <body><img src="https://www.msu.edu/~marqua47/modules/Website.JPG" style="width:230px;height:300px;padding: 15px" align="right"> Hi, I am Maddy. Welcome to my online portfolio! Presently, I am a sophomore at Michigan State University in East Lansing Michigan, majoring in Neuroscience and Professional Writing. When I’m not in class, I spend my time working through the MSU Writing Center, both as a Writing Consultant and as a Writing Studio Mentor for the Lyman-Briggs freshman HPS course. This means that I spend a lot of time working with people to improve their pre-writing, writing, and revision skills. I plan to graduate in spring of 2018.

        I have played soccer since I was 7, and during high school spent time coaching younger girls. When I’m not playing soccer, I like to run with my sister, who is a whole lot faster than me. I also like to read, and consider myself to have fantastic literary taste. I absolutely love all of Margaret Atwood’s work, particularly The Blind Assassin, and have read the entire Harry Potter series around five times over. Other hobbies of mine include playing guitar, knitting, and letting other people cook food for me. As you probably have guessed, I also like to write. 
        <br>
        </br>
        In my spare time, I have volunteered both in clinical settings and in child care. I spent time as an Emergency Room Volunteer over the summer of 2015, where I not only acquired some serious blanket and coffee- fetching skills, but also met and helped a variety of people from different backgrounds. In the spring of 2015, I volunteered at the Northwind Rehabilitation Center. Despite my being the volunteer, the residents of Northwind have helped me more than I could have ever helped them. I learned a lot about the importance of listening, which I have applied in my current job at the Writing Center, and heard some great stories. Nothing quite compares to knowing someone is excited to have a conversation with you, and the residents at Northwind looked forward to the hours the other volunteers and I spent talking with them. I also enjoy helping others learn, and have done quite a bit of tutoring in high school level algebra through the National Honor Society at Lake Orion High School.
